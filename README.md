## Features

- Converts decimal numbers into **binary format**.
- Normalizes the binary form and calculates the **exponent and mantissa**.
- Supports **IEEE 754 Single Precision (32-bit)** format.
- Supports **IEEE 754 Double Precision (64-bit)** format.
- Handles special cases like `0`, infinities, and NaN.

## Getting Started
